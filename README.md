# thingiverse-easy-download
A Chrome extension that adds a direct download button to Thingiverse search results.

This extension currently does not work due to Thingiverse constantly losing application keys.

Sometimes when you're browsing Thingiverse you just want to download something without going to the thing's page.  This extension lets you do that.  It doesn't do anything else.  It doesn't need your username or password.  It doesn't need to put anything in local storage.  It doesn't have any settings to tweak.  As you scroll down through search results or "similar items" etc. on a page, it'll add a "Download" link so that you can grab the files.
